<b>m 0 650 l 0 720 l 1280 720 l 1280 650 {p0}</b>

22:06.175 --> 22:11.595
Even the number of several billion heartbeats

22:11.594 --> 22:18.274
is a basic matter of little glamor to you

22:18.274 --> 22:23.354
Imprisoned in the past we lament the future

22:23.354 --> 22:29.404
and not even miscalculating a single speck of dust would be permissible

22:29.404 --> 22:35.414
Our dreams stretching out as infinity and the future we imagine

22:35.414 --> 22:41.334
are a vain privilege we allowed ourselves

22:41.334 --> 22:47.504
Finity is what the two hands of the clock point out

22:47.504 --> 22:52.094
forcing us to make cruel decisions in life

22:52.094 --> 22:54.384
Hacking to the Gate

22:54.384 --> 23:01.314
Now I cross world lines with every passing second

23:01.314 --> 23:06.274
and wish to protect your smile
