<b>m 0 650 l 0 720 l 1280 720 l 1280 650 {p0}</b>

22:06.091 --> 22:11.511
Even the number of several billion heartbeats

22:11.510 --> 22:18.190
is a basic matter of little glamor to you

22:18.190 --> 22:23.270
Imprisoned in the past we lament the future

22:23.270 --> 22:29.320
and not even miscalculating a single speck of dust would be permissible

22:29.320 --> 22:35.330
Our dreams stretching out as infinity and the future we imagine

22:35.330 --> 22:41.250
are a vain privilege we allowed ourselves

22:41.250 --> 22:47.420
Finity is what the two hands of the clock point out

22:47.420 --> 22:52.010
forcing us to make cruel decisions in life

22:52.010 --> 22:54.300
Hacking to the Gate

22:54.300 --> 23:01.230
Now I cross world lines with every passing second

23:01.230 --> 23:06.190
and wish to protect your smile

23:06.190 --> 23:13.070
Now I am again sucked into a time loop as a solitary observer
